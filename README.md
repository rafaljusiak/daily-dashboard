# Daily Dashboard

This service is the result of my learning journey in Go, Terraform, and Google Cloud Platform. It serves as a tool for efficiently calculating my income based on my work hours data.

## Getting Started

1. **Configuration**: Copy the `config.json.example` file and fill in the required data.

    ```bash
    cp config.json.example config.json
    ```

    Open the `config.json` file in a text editor and replace the placeholders with your keys and IDs.

2. **Deploy the Service**: Execute the following command to launch the Daily Dashboard service.

    ```bash
    ./blast/off.sh
    ```

3. **Access the Dashboard**: Once the service is deployed, up and running, you can access the dashboard through your web browser.
